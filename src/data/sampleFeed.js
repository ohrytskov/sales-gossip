    excerpt: `Thought the lead ghosted me 👻. It had been weeks.
Not only did I get a reply, but the deal closed in 2 days. Sales is human. Sometimes a little personality does what 5 follow-up emails can’t.
But instead of sending another “just checking in” email 📩 , I sent a short voice note with a quick update and a joke we laughed about during the call —this was with @NimbusWorks. 💰`,
